# Arduino-controlled-Floating-Sun-tracking-Mini-Solar-Panel-Mech-3401-
The goal of this project is to create an Arduino-controlled floating design, that can track the sun with a mini solar panel.  I created two sub-systems, that complete the design requirements. The first sub-system charges an AA battery, while the other rotates the solar panel based on the data provided by the IR sensors.
